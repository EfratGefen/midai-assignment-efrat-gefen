Base image: python:3.10-slim.

Installed dependencies: ultralytics, opencv-python, openai
Added both Part 1 and Part 2 scripts under /app.

Defined CMD to run Part 1 followed by Part 2.

Used /app/results for output, mapped to host with a Docker volume.

The output was mostly accurate, especially with well-formatted specs.

I had to refine the prompt to ensure consistency in key naming and nested structures.

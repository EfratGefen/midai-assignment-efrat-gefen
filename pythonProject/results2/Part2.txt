I used GPT to convert a structured spec text into JSON format.

The prompt requested material types, dimensions, usage, and standards.

The input included five construction elements with clear technical details.

The model was guided to output a clean, consistent specifications.json.



The output was highly accurate due to the clear structure of the input.

Minor prompt tweaks were needed to ensure consistent field naming across items.
